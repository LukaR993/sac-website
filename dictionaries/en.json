      "description": "The story of our company begins back in 1989, with the founding and operation of the artisan bakery 'Vladika', which over more than a decade became synonymous with quality, reliability, and attention to every detail. This fundamental approach to work, people, and products has been carried into the DNA of our current company – Sač, founded in 2002. With over two decades of experience and continuous growth, Sač is now recognized as one of the leading distributors of high-quality raw materials and additives for the bakery, confectionery, and meat processing industries, as well as for beer production, wine additives, and the animal feed market. Our slogan 'Only the best from nature' is not just empty words, but a principle that guides us in every aspect of our business. From the very beginning, we have been proud and exclusive representatives of IREKS GmbH from Kulmbach, Germany. IREKS is a global name, synonymous with innovation, precision, and uncompromising quality in the bakery, confectionery, brewing, and meat industries. Thanks to this partnership, for over 20 years we have provided our customers in Montenegro with access to modern solutions, functional mixes, and expert knowledge that make a difference in every loaf and pastry. We are also extremely proud of our exclusive partnership with the Austrian mill Kärntner Mühle, a top family business with a centuries-old tradition, known for milling the highest quality grains from the heart of the Alps. Their respect for nature and production processes fits perfectly with our business philosophy and brings the Montenegrin market the finest flours that preserve authentic taste and exceptional nutritional value. We are also proud of our strong partnership with the BMM mill from Kać, a modern facility from Serbia recognized for its high standards of quality and advanced technology. Thanks to carefully selected raw materials and control at every stage of production, BMM delivers stable, functional, and nutritionally rich flours, ideal for the professional baking industry. Our portfolio is complemented by products from the Italian company UNIGRA, known for the Master Martini brand, as well as offerings from other renowned European manufacturers, providing our partners with variety, consistent quality, and a competitive edge. Many of our Montenegrin partners, with whom we have collaborated for decades, have been awarded at international fairs, and behind these recognitions stands our strong support – in the form of raw materials, expert advice, and reliable logistics – that we have provided for years. Sač is not just a distributor. We are a partner. Support. The link between tradition and modern business. Our goal is not only to deliver a product, but to contribute daily to the success of our clients and the strengthening of the Montenegrin market and offering to end consumers.",
